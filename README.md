# Bank X Application

## Overview

The **Bank X Application** is a standalone Spring Boot-based banking system designed to support both internal and external system integrations. 
It enables customer onboarding, account management, transaction tracking, and external bank integration. 
The system provides a full-stack experience with a backend in Java and a frontend rendered with Thymeleaf.

## Business Case

Bank X aims to modernize its banking system with the following core features:

- Onboard new customers with automatic creation of both **Current** and **Savings** accounts.
- Credit a **joining bonus** of R500.00 to every new customerâ€™s **Savings Account**.
- Support **fund transfers** between accounts.
- Enable **payments** only from the **Current Account**.
- Credit **0.5% interest** to the **Savings Account** for all deposits.
- Charge **0.05% fee** on all outgoing payments.
- Maintain a **complete transaction history**.
- Send **notifications** to customers for every transaction event.
- Allow **Bank Z** to:
  - Perform **immediate debit/credit transactions** on Bank X customer accounts.
  - Submit a **batch of transactions** for reconciliation at the end of each business day.
